Breakout Gameplay Improvement using Reinforcement Learning

This project focuses on enhancing the gameplay experience of the classic game Breakout by leveraging reinforcement learning techniques. The goal was to train an AI model using reward-based feedback to improve the speed of gameplay without compromising accuracy.
How it Works

The project follows a reinforcement learning approach to train an AI agent to play Breakout. The agent interacts with the game environment, receives observations as input, and takes actions based on learned policies. Through a trial-and-error process, the agent learns to maximize the cumulative rewards obtained during gameplay.

To improve the gameplay speed without sacrificing accuracy, the reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to optimize both factors simultaneously. By considering the rewards obtained and the desired speed, the AI agent learns to make efficient decisions, ensuring a fast-paced and engaging gaming experience.
